That allow you install the project's dependences without installing it on the rest of the system

## virtualenv
virtualenv is a tool used to create isolated Python environments. Create a folder that contains all the executables needed to use the
packages that a Python project would need.

You can install it with pip:

    pip install virtualenv

    virtualenv (path directory)

## Activate an environment
Before using the environment, you must activate it:

    source (path directory)/bin/activate
