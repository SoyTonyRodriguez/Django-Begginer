# Django shell

The Django shell is an interactive command-line interface provided by Django for interacting
with your Django project and its data using Python code. It allows you to work with your Django
models, query the database, and perform various operations without having to create and run.
full-fledged scripts or web pages.

To start the Django shell, open your command-line terminal and navigate to your Django project's
directory. Then, run the following command:

```sh
python manage.py shell
```
